# Hi! I'm Lorenzo

With a background in quantitative finance, my current interests lie in Blockchain and building payment solutions. I love solving puzzles and frequent the linkedin games leaderboards. I majored in Computer Science after dropping out of music school,

When I'm not behind a computer screen, I love to play the guitar, DJ, debate, and spend time outdoors. I love to bring multidisciplinary people together, and spent a lot of time doing that in college.
