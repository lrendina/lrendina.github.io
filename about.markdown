# Hi! I'm Lorenzo

I'm a blockchain developer, problem solver, serial complexity unpacker, a DJ, and above all figuring it out.

I love diving into complex topics, my current interests are Blockchain and Machine Learning.
I love to work with people and solve problems in a collaborative setting.
At some point I will have my DJ work on here and maybe some music
